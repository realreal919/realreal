// Sentry first, so its instrumentation and global handlers are installed before
// anything below is constructed. This is the SAME module the API process uses
// (src/sentry.ts): the `enabled` gate is "is a SENTRY_DSN set", never
// NODE_ENV — Railway does not guarantee it injects NODE_ENV, and a NODE_ENV gate
// fails closed exactly when reporting matters.
//
// Until now the worker had no Sentry at all: BullMQ job failures and worker
// crashes were logged to stdout and nowhere else.
//
// ⚠️ Only `Sentry.captureException` is used below — never `sendAlert`.
// sentry.ts's `beforeSend` is the single place alerts are emailed, and it
// already applies a 15-minute per-fingerprint dedupe plus a 10/hour global cap.
// Alerting here as well would send two emails for one failure and, with
// `attempts: 5` on most jobs, five failed attempts of the SAME job would become
// five emails instead of one.

 *
 * The timeout is not optional. Amego's HTTP timeout is 45s (lib/amego.ts) while
 * Railway's grace period before SIGKILL is far shorter, so an unbounded wait
 * guarantees the platform kills us mid-request — the exact ungraceful case this
 * handler exists to remove. Bounding it means we choose *when* to stop rather
 * than having it chosen for us, and the log line below says which happened.
 *
 * Being killed mid-issue is no longer able to double-issue an invoice either
 * way: the row is left in 'issuing' with issue_attempts incremented, so whoever
 * picks it up next queries Amego by OrderId before issuing anything (migration
 * 0049 + lib/issue-invoice.ts). Graceful shutdown reduces how often we land in
 * that recovery path; it is not what makes it safe.
